=====================
This is a simple static CV Engine/Template, forked originally from the [repository](https://github.com/btamas/btamas.github.com) of [@btamas](https://github.com/btamas).

I just added a few new features like these:
 - MVC principle development: After the basic configuration you have to edit just cv-data.js to keep your CV up-to-date
 - Export to PDF: You can easily export your CV to PDF using a shell script and make it available
